     <p><b>Umiam Lake</b> also known as Bara Pani, is a reservoir in the hills 15 km north of Shillong in the state of Meghalaya, India. It was created by damming the Umiam River in the early 1960s. The principal catchment area of the lake and dam is spread over 225 square kilometres. Umiam Dam, which impounds the lake, was built by the Assam State Electricity Board in the early 1960s. The dam's original purpose was to store water for hydroelectric power generation. The Umiam Stage I powerhouse, north of the lake, has four 9-MW turbine-generators, which entered commercial operation in 1965. Umiam Stage I was the first reservoir-storage hydroelectric project commissioned in the northeastern region of India. (Umtru Hydroelectric Project, a run-of-river project with an original capacity of 8.4 MW, began operation in 1957). Three more stages of the Umiam Project were subsequently built downstream.</p>

        <img src="meghalaya2.jpg" alt="Mawsmai Cave" height="150px" width="200px" align="left" >
        <p><b>Mawsmai Cave</b> Mawsmai Cave is located at a short distance from Sohra and is an easy attraction to access and explore. There are some places inside the cave where you will need to squeeze around and crawl â€“ and this adds to the experience of cave exploration. The Mawsmai cave route that is accessible to tourists is not very long and is very safe so you do not want to miss out on this unique opportunity. The cave is also famous for its fossils, some which you can spot if you spend some time peering at the walls and formations inside.The ten longest caves (and more) in the country are all in Meghalaya. These subterranean networks spread across the southern ranges like a complex network of routes formed by the erosion of limestone and unrelenting flow of water. Mawsmai offers a glimpse into this fascinating world underneath our feet.</p>

    <div class="Meghalaya">
        <img src="meghalaya3.jpg" alt="Dainthlen falls " height="150px" width="200px" align="left">
        <p><b>Dainthlen Falls</b> is one of the most powerful sights you will come across, a gushing waterfall that cuts through the hard rocks and the high plateau of Sohra before it cascades down into lush forests. It is also a culturally significant place for the Khasi tribe.

            During the drier seasons, you will be able to negotiate the hard, rocky pot-holed river bed leading to the falls. According to local folktales, this spot is where a great battle was fought. The Thlen was a giant serpent, an embodiment of evil who was finally vanquished by the local residents of an ancient village that is now Sohra. The thundering sound of the Dainthlen Falls, the open landscape, the surrounding hillocks, and the capricious winds that constantly blow here provide an apt setting for such a grand legend.
