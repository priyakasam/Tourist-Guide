     <p><b>Vantawng Fall</b> is the highest and most spectacular of all the waterfalls and cascades in the fast flowing rivers of Mizoram. It is located in Vanva river near Thenzawl and is named after Vantawnga who was said to be an excellent swimmer.<br>The height of the fall is recorded as 750 ft and though it is difficult to get close to it because of the sheer forested hillsides surrounding it, a comfortable viewing tower has been constructed.<br>

        September to January are the best months to visit Vantawng Falls due to greater clarity. The waterfall is visible running at its full might through the verdant Mizo Hills. The greenery surrounding the waterfall is also accentuated and thick during these months of the year. The winters months will be cold due to high altitude and some protection is required from the cold especially during night time. Hence be generous while you pack woollens.</p>

        <p><b>Aizawl</b> is a quaint city and the capital of the state of Mizoram in northeast India. Primarily dominated by the Mizo Tribe, Aizawl and its surrounding areas are lush with rolling hills and abundant greenery. The city, along with the majority of the state is known for its agricultural produce and ethnic handicrafts and apparel. Aizawl is well connected via roads and air connectivity to other major hubs of northeast India such as Silchar and Guwahati in Assam. An important thing to note is that an Inner Line Pass or ILP is required for entry into Mizoram which is available on Guwahati, Silchar, Shillong, New Delhi and Kolkata.

            Among one of the oldest cities in the north eastern region of India, Aizawl, pronounced eye-zole, is a perfect place to relax while enjoying the local food and culture. Home to the Mizoram State Museum and few other tourist complexes, tourists have few options to enjoy a sightseeing tour in the city. Apart from these, one can take a tour to the nearby hilly areas of Hmuifang, Tamdil Lake and Chanmari.

        <p><b>Solomon's Temple</b> is a church located in Aizawl Mizoram, India. The temple was constructed by the religious group Kohhran Thianghlim, translated as 'The Holy Church' in English. It was founded by Dr. L.B. Sailo in 1984 and is non-denominational. The temple is one of the largest in Mizoram state. The Temple area accommodates 2,000 people within the main hall and 10,000 within its courtyard. It is a square site measuring 180 ft. on each side. The interior of the Temple building is also square, measuring 120 ft. on each side. A 30 ft. wide verandah called 'The porch of Solomon's Temple' is attached to the exterior of the main hall on all four sides. This provides a shelter for people with its sizeable seating capacity.
            The temple holds church services each Sunday. It also hosts special events such as Zanlai Au Aw (Midnight Herald) Anniversary organized by the Publication Board of Kohhran Thianghlim, </p>
